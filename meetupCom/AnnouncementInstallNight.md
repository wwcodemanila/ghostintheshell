**Linux Install Night**

When: April 16, 2021, 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.

Where: Mini Events Room Voice Channel, WWCode Manila Discord Server

If you're having trouble installing Linux on your machine for the "WWCodeManila's TechUp: Ghost In The Shell (Or How To Navigate Through Linux)" event on April 17, do join us here so we can help you with your set up!

We can help you if you're trying to do any of the following:

- Install WSL2.
- Fire up Linux on a virtual machine.

Things to know:

- You will have to use your mobile phone instead of the desktop to access Discord. You will also be using your phone's camera. That way we can see what's happening to your machine even when you reboot your computer.
- For Virtual Machine users: Please make sure you have downloaded the necessary software before you join Install Night. You can download the following:
	- VirtualBox 6.1.x (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
	- Ubuntu 20.04.02 VirtualBox image (https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/)
